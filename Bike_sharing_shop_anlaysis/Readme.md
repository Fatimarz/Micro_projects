## Problem Statement
The Bike-Sharing shop wants to gain comprehensive understanding of its financial performance through an in depth-analysis of various business aspects. The goal is to use insights derived from this analysis to support strategic decision-making, helping the company to enhance its profitability and optimize operations. 
##  Key Metrics
1. **Hourly Revenue Analysis:** Understand the hourly revenue generation patterns to identify peak hours and optimize operational efficiency.

2. **Profit and Revenue Trends:** Analyze overall profit and revenue trends over time to assess business growth and identify any potential areas for improvement.

3. **Seasonal Revenue:** Examine seasonal variations in revenue to better predict and prepare for fluctuations in customer demand across different times of the year.

4. **Rider Demographics:** Explore the demographics of the rider to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
## Technologies Used
**SQL:**
* Database management 
*  Writing queries for data extraction and analysis.

**Power BI:**
* Data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Summary of Insights
* **Hourly Revenue Analysis:** 
The analysis of hourly revenue shows that the bike-sharing shop experiences the highest revenue during the evening hours, likely due to evening rush hour, when customers are more inclined to rent bikes for commuting home or other evening activities.

However, there is a noticeable decline in later hours, likely due to reduced commuting needs and the general winding down of daily activities.

* **Revenue and Profit Trend Analysis:** The trend line for average revenue shows increase from January, peaking in mid-year before declining thereafter. This pattern indicates strong performance during mid-year, likely influenced by seasonal factors.

The profit line mirrors the revenue trend, suggesting that profit fluctuations are directly tied to revenue changes. Notably, the profit margin remains constant at 0.45 throughout the year, indicating stable cost management relative to revenue.

* **Seasonal Revenue Analysis:**

The seasonal revenue analysis reveals that Season 3 generates the highest revenue, significantly outperforming other periods.Season 2 and also shows robust revenue figures, although not as high. In contrast, Season 1 records the lowest revenue, indicating a potential period of reduced customer demand or market activity.

* **Rider Demographics Analysis**

Approximately 80% of riders are registered users, while the remaining 20% are casual riders. This distribution highlights a strong base of loyal, engaged customers who are more likely to contribute to consistent revenue. Casual riders represent a smaller yet significant portion, potentially indicating opportunities for conversion to registered status.

## Recommendations and Next Steps:

* The high revenue during Evening Hours suggests that these hours are critical for the shop's profitability. It would be advantageous to optimize operations during these times, such as ensuring bike availability, offering quick checkout processes, and possibly running promotions to further capitalize on this high-demand period.

* The steep decline in revenue after Evening hours presents an opportunity to either scale back operations to save costs or introduce strategies to boost nighttime rentals. Considerations might include offering late-night discounts, targeting specific customer groups like night-shift workers, or even adjusting operating hours to reflect demand.

* To maximize revenue, focus on strategies that leverage the strengths of Season 3 and 2, such as targeted promotions or increased inventory. For Season 1, consider implementing initiatives to boost customer engagement and demand, such as special offers or marketing campaigns, to enhance performance during this lower revenue period.

* Focus on enhancing engagement and retention strategies for registered riders to maintain their loyalty and maximize their lifetime value. Simultaneously, develop targeted marketing campaigns and incentives to convert casual riders into registered users, thereby expanding your customer base and increasing overall revenue stability.
