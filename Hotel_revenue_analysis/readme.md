# Hotel Revenue Analysis 




## Background
LuxeStay Hotel, established five years ago, started as a single luxury property and has since grown into a chain with multiple locations worldwide. Known for its premium service and guest-centric approach, LuxeStay quickly became a favorite among both business and leisure travelers.
## Problem Statement
As LuxeStay Hotel rapidly expanded, it faced increasing challenges in managing large volumes of guest data, optimizing operations, and maintaining consistent customer experiences across multiple locations. Inefficient strategies and operational gaps led to a decline in guest satisfaction, causing customers to shift to competitors. 
## Objective
Hotel aims to leverage historical data to gain actionable insights, enabling the hotel to regain market share, improve customer retention, and boost overall revenue.

## Key Metrics
The following key metrics were derived from the existing data to assess the hotel's performance:

**Revenue:** Total revenue earned from all bookings.

**RevPAR:** (Revenue Per Available Room): Measures revenue generated per available room.

**Occupancy %:** Percentage of successfully booked rooms compared to the total available rooms.

**ADR (Average Daily Rate):** Average revenue earned per occupied room per day.

**Cancellation %:** Percentage of bookings canceled out of the total bookings.

**Average Rating:** Average customer rating based on feedback.

**No-show %:** Percentage of customers who did not show up for their bookings.

## Insights
Data analysis revealed the following key insights:

**Lack of Dynamic Pricing:**

 The hotel is not utilizing a dynamic pricing strategy, as revenue remains consistent between weekdays and weekends, missing potential opportunities for increased earnings.

**Low Average Rating:** 

The low average customer rating indicates that the hotel's services are falling short of customer expectations, potentially impacting guest satisfaction and loyalty.


## Recommendations
Implement Dynamic Pricing: To maximize revenue, especially during peak periods such as weekends and summer months, the hotel should adopt a dynamic pricing strategy. This approach will allow for price adjustments based on demand, increasing profitability.

Improve Customer Satisfaction: The low average rating suggests a gap in service quality. A deeper analysis of customer feedback, including reviews and comments on social media, should be conducted to identify specific areas for improvement. Addressing these concerns will help enhance guest experiences and boost ratings.
